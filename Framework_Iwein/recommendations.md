# Recommendations

In this file there are some recommendations and tips on how to set up your work environment to use the framework.

1. Some of the functionalities of the framework might not work with version 19 and previous of Oxygen. Install Oxygen 20 or higher.

2. Allow for long lines without line breaks: Go to 'Options' -> 'Preferences'. Select the tab 'Editor' -> 'Format'. In the section *Format and Indent* uncheck all options and set 'Line width' to a high number (for example 10000)

3. Set the 'Elements Spacing' options to avoid inconveniences. Go to 'Options' -> 'Preferences'. Select the tab 'Editor' -> 'Format' -> 'XML':

   In the section *Format*, make sure 'Preserve Text as it is' is selected, and all other options are not selected.
   In the section *Elements Spacing* go to 'Mixed Content'. Add the following elements using the 'add' button:
   - choice
   - hi
   - l
   - p
   - subst
   - w
